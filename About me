I'm UX / UI designer with great experience in web and mobile. My aim is to create better interfaces and experiences for the user, making the web, applicationâ€™s and technology easier for the user. Simplifying communication barriers by bridging the gap between end-users, designers and developer..... Comprehensive Analysis: I study competitors, similar products, collect interesting solutions, and look for strategic ideas. That is, I will completely immerse myself in the project in order to determine what the product should be and how to make it unique and different from competitors.
